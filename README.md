# ising

a simple, fun simulation of the ising model. the size and temperature of the simulation are constants, as is the spacing between dipoles. the simulation finds the energy change that will occur if a dipole is flipped and then uses a boltzmann factor to find the probability of the flip occuring. i actually made this a couple months ago but forgot to post it oops
