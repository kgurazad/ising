# ising

a simple, fun simulation of the ising model. the size and temperature of the simulation are constants, as is the spacing between dipoles. the simulation finds the energy change that will occur if a dipole is flipped and then uses a boltzmann factor to find the probability of the flip occuring. i actually made this a couple months ago but forgot to post it oops

## how to use

~~don't~~
you can download the files in the src folder and run the Driver class \[which has the main method\]
you can modify the temperature/size of the model by changing variable values in there
it looks pretty :)
